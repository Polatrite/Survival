<h1>The DM HTML Library</h1>

<p>You can use HTML forms to obtain information from users in a graphical
dialogue.  To retrieve a single piece of information, one normally uses
input(), but a long chain of prompts can become irksome to the user.  The
solution is to create a form containing entries for each item.

<p>Programs that generate HTML (or any other code for that matter) often
appear rather noisy.  This programming library, if it achieves anything,
helps to elliminate much of that noise, so your code doesn't look like a
garbled superposition of two languages arguing with each other over who
controls the punctuation.

<a name=tutorial>
<h2>Tutorial</h2>

<p>You define a form by deriving your own from the base <code>/Form</code>
type.  The variables you define become entry fields in the form.  These are
called interface elements.

<a name=defining>
<h3>Defining the Form</h3>

<p>Here is a very simple form definition.

<xmp>
#include "html/form.dm"
Form/Newbie
   var
      name
      gender
      race
</xmp>

<p>That defines a form type <code>/Form/Newbie</code> with three fields:
name, gender, and race.

<a name=displaying>
<h3>Displaying the Form</h3>

<p>You can submit this form to a player by calling
<code>DisplayForm()</code>.

<xmp>
mob/verb/myinfo()
   var/Form/Newbie/frm = new()
   frm.DisplayForm()  //send usr the form
</xmp>

<p>If you try that, you should see the form pop up in the browser window
when you use the <code>myinfo</code> verb.

<p>There are several things to note at this point.  One is that the form
doesn't do anything.  Another is that all three fields use the same type of
interface element--a text box.  Lastly, the form always starts out blank.
The following examples will rectify these problems.

<a name=processing>
<h3>Processing the Form</h3>

<p>When the form is complete, its <code>ProcessForm()</code> procedure is
called.  You can define it to do whatever you want.

<xmp>
Form/Newbie
   proc
      ProcessForm()
         usr.name = name
         usr.gender = gender
         usr.race = race
         usr << browse("You have been modified!")
mob/var
   race //human, ogre, or jellyfish
</xmp>

<p>It is a good idea to output something to the browser acknowledging
receipt of the form.  Otherwise, the user is left feeling like nothing
happened.

<a name=initializing>
<h3>Initializing the Form</h3>

<p>In the same way that the form variables were accessed in
<code>ProcessForm()</code>, they can be initialized in
<code>Initialize()</code>.  This is automaitcally called by
<code>DisplayForm</code> before generating the form's HTML.

<xmp>
Form/Newbie/Initialize()
   name = usr.name
   gender = usr.gender
   race = usr.race
</xmp>

<p>Of course, you are free to initialize the form variables in the same
place where you create the form.  Do whichever is more convenient.

<a name=interface>
<h3>Basic Inteface Elements</h3>

<p>A text-box is a good interface element for entering the name, but it is
not so good for race and gender, where the possible values are restricted.
By telling the form to restrict the range of values the user may enter, it
will automatically use a more appropriate interface element.

<xmp>
Form/Newbie
   var
      name

      gender
      gender_1 = "male"
      gender_2 = "female"
      gender_3 = "neuter"

      race
      race_values = list("human","ogre","jellyfish")
</xmp>

<p>Notice the two different techniques for limiting the input values.  In
the case of gender, we enumerated three possibilities by declaring variables
<code>gender_1</code>, <code>gender_2</code>, and <code>gender_3</code>.
That produces a <em>radio toggle</em> interface element.  The user can turn
on any one and only one of the three genders.

<p>The second technique for restricting the range of input is with a list of
values.  By defining <code>race_values</code>, we told the form to use a
<em>selection list</em> interface element.  The user can select one item
from the list.

<p>There are other types of interface elements.  You can learn about those
in the reference section.  These basic ones will satisfy most of your
needs.

<a name=layout>
<h3>Form Layout</h3>

<p>The layout of your form has so far been automatically generated.  You can
design the html yourself by overriding the <code>HtmlLayout()</code> procedure.

<xmp>
Form/Newbie
   proc
      HtmlLayout() return \
{"
Your name: [name] <br>
Your gender:      <br>
[gender_1] male   <br>
[gender_2] female <br>
[gender_3] other  <br>
Your race: [race] <br>
[submit]
"}
</xmp>

<p>Wherever you want an interface element to appear, you simply embed the
associated variable.  (Before <code>HtmlLayout()</code> is called, each of the
variables is automatically assigned to the html code that produces the
desired interface element.)  The special <var>submit</var> variable produces
a button that submits the form.  There is also a <var>reset</var> variable
so the user can undo changes and start over.

<p>Since this is an HTML document, you have to use &lt;br&gt; wherever you
want a line break.  For convenience, we did use a text document (curly
braces around the double quotes), so newlines could be embedded directly in the
text, but the browser treates those just like spaces.  You can use any other
HTML tricks you want in order to control the appearance.

<a name=reference>
<h2>Reference</h2>

<p>A form has three basic components: interface variables, graphical layout,
and a processing procedure.  The details of these are described in the
following reference sections.

<a name=var/udef>
<h3>User Defined Interface Variables</h3>

<p>A form is defined by the variables it contains.  Each interface variable
represents a piece of information that the user can view and modify.  There
are also non-interface variables that control the properties of the
interface elements or that you define for your own purposes.

<p>The control variables are described in the following sections.

<a name=var/udef_iface>
<h4>Interface Types</h4>

<p>By default, each variable you define creates a corresponding text box
interface ellement.  You can select a different interface element by
defining an <code>_interface</code> control variable.

<xmp>
Form/Login
   var
      name
      password
      password_interface = PASSWORD
</xmp>

<p>As the above example demonstrates, the control variable is defined with
the same base name as the interface variable with <code>_interface</code>
appended.

<p>In this particular example, the PASSWORD interface type was used.  That
prevents the user's input from being displayed on the screen.  This and the
other interface types are described below.

<dl>

<dt>TEXT</dt> <dd>This is the default interface element.  It presents a text
box in which the user may edit a short text string.  Note that this may be
used for editing numbers as well as text.  If the input type of the variable
is numeric (achieved by initializing the variable to a number), the input
from the text box will be automatically converted to a number for you.</dd>

<dt>PASSWORD</dt> <dd>This is just like TEXT, but the contents are not
visible on the screen.</dd>

<dt>TEXTAREA</dt> <dd>Like a text box, this allows the user to input any
value.  It may be used for editing multi-line messages.  This is the default
interface element if you set the <code>_size</code> control variable to a
value of the form "10x30" where 10 is the number of rows and 30 is the
number of columns to display at one time.</dd>

<dt>SELECT</dt> <dd>A selection list restricts the user to a choice of one
value from a list.  This is the default interface element if you set the
<code>_values</code> control variable.</dd>

<dt>MULTI_SELECT</dt> <dd>This is just like SELECT, except the user may
select more than one item from the list.</dd>

<dt>CHECKBOX</dt> <dd>The user may turn this interface element on or off.
When it is off, the variable has a false value (like null) and when it is
on, it has a true value (like 1).</dd>

<dt>CHECKLIST</dt> <dd>This produces a list of check boxes, each with a
different corresponding value.  The functionality is similar to
MULTI_SELECT, but you have control over how each item in the list is
displayed.  This interface behaves a little differently from the others
during HtmlLayout().  The value of the variable is a list of the values you
assigned to the <code>_values</code> control variable and each of these has
an associated html value.  You access the html by indexing the interface
variable with each of the possible values.  When the form is processed, the
interface variable will contain a list of the values checked by the
user.</dd>

<dt>RADIO</dt> <dd>A radio toggle lets the user pick one of a number of
options.  You don't use this directly but instead define numbered control
variables for each option (<code>_1</code>, <code>_2</code>,
<code>_3</code>, and so on).  You may assign values to each of these.  If
you do not, the option number will be used.</dd>

<dt>RADIO_LIST</dt> <dd>This is like a CHECKLIST except the user may only
choose one item from the list.  The choices are assigned to
<code>_values</code> and the user's response is assigned to the interface
variable.  You access the html by indexing the interface variable with each
of the possible values, just as with CHECKLIST.

<a name=var/udef_iface/HIDDEN></a> <dt>HIDDEN</dt> <dd>This allows you to
hide an interface variable from the user.  You might want to do that when
the form is one of a sequence of dialogues and you need to retain
information from previous steps as you move along.  Like any other interface
type, you have to embed the variable in the html if you override
HtmlLayout().  To have the variable automatically embedded, use the <a
href=#var/udef_hidden>_hidden</a> control variable instead.</dd>

<dt>BUTTON</dt> <dd>This generates a button on the form.  When the user
clicks it, your procedure (called <var>varname</var>Click()) is called.  The
value of this variable (when DisplayForm() is called) is displayed on the
button face.  If the value is null, the name of the variable is used
instead.</dd>

<dt>PROMPT</dt> <dd>Like BUTTON, this produces a button on the form.  Your
<var>varname</var>Click() procedure is called and the return value is
assigned to this variable.  That allows you to prompt the user for anything
you want.  The most common prompts have special interface elements that do
it for you.</dd>

<dt>PROMPT_FOR_ICON</dt> <dd>This is like PROMPT, except you don't define a
Click() proc.  It does the prompting for you.  The icon file uploaded by the
user gets assigned to the interface variable.</dd>

<dt>PROMPT_FOR_SOUND</dt> <dd>This prompts the user for a sound file to
upload.</dd>

<dt>PROMPT_FOR_FILE</dt> <dd>This prompts the user for any file to upload.
This works in CGI mode (through a web browser) as well as in Dream Seeker.
The generic PROMPT and BUTTON interfaces do not work in CGI mode, so if you
want the user to upload a file, do it through this specific interface.</dd>

<dt>SUB_FORM</dt> <dd>This is a variable containing another form object.  It
is the default interface type if you initialize the variable to a new
instance of a form (which you have to do anyway for it to work).  The
sub-form is embedded in the main form and is submitted and processed as part
of a single HTML form.</dd>

</dl>

<a name=var/udef_size>
<h4>Display Size</h4>

<p>The <code>_size</code> control variable specifies the amount of data to
display at one time (without scrolling) in the interface element.  It does
not effect the maximum length of data that the user may enter.

<p>With a text box interface element, this specifies the number of
characters that may be visible at one time.  The default behavior depends on
the browser.  You can set your own default using <a
href=#var/other/form_default_size>form_default_size</a>.

<p>For a TEXTAREA interface element, the size specifies the number of rows
to display.  In addition, the number of columns may be set using the format
"30x10" where 30 is the number of columns and 10 is the number of rows.  In
that case, the interface element defaults to TEXTAREA.

<a name=var/udef_maxlen>
<h4>Maximum Length</h4>

<p>The <code>_maxlen</code> control variable specifies the maximum number of
characters that the user may enter.  If none is specified, <a
href=#var/other/form_default_maxlen>form_default_maxlen</a> will be used.
If that is not specified, no limit will be applied.

<a name=var/udef_values>
<h4>Possible Values</h4>

<p>The <code>_values</code> control variable specifies a list of values to
display in a selection list.  If it is defined, the interface element
defaults to SELECT.

<a name=var/udef_validate>
<h4>Validate Input</h4>

<p>The <code>_validate</code> control variable determines whether it is an
error to receive input from the user that is not in the values list.  It is
on by default.

<a name=var/udef_label>
<h4>Form Label</h4>

<p>The <code>_label</code> control variable is used by the default form
layout generator to label the interface element.  If no label is specified,
the variable name (capitalized) is used.

<a name=var/udef_hidden>
<h4>Hidden Variable</h4>

<p>The <code>_hidden</code> control variable causes the variable to be
automatically stored in the form but with no visible interface.  (Assign
_hidden to a true value.)  This is a similar effect to the <a
href=#var/udef_iface/HIDDEN>HIDDEN</a> interface type, except HIDDEN variables
are not automatically embedded in the form if you override HtmlLayout().

<a name=var/udef_wrap>
<h4>Wrapping</h4>

<p>The <code>_wrap</code> control variable may be used to configure the text
wrapping in a textarea edit box.  It may be assigned to any of the following:

<dl compact>
<dt>NO_WRAP    <dd>no wrapping of text
<dt>SOFT_WRAP  <dd>text is wrapped but newlines are not inserted into the result
<dt>HARD_WRAP  <dd>text is wrapped and newlines are inserted where it wraps
</dl>

<a name=var/udef_extra>
<h4>Extra Input Parameters</h4>

<p>If you need to insert some special html code into the input tag for an
interface element, you may do so with the <code>_extra</code> control
variable.  A common example of this would be the insertion of <a
href=http://www.javascript.com>Java Script</a> code.

<h5>Example:</h5>
<xmp>
Form/MyForm
	var
		submit_extra = {"OnClick='return confirm("Are you sure?");'"}
</xmp>

<p>See also, <a href=var/other/form_extra>form_extra</a>.

<a name=var/idef>
<h3>Pre-Defined Interface Variables</h3>

<p>In addition to the interface elements defined above, there are two
more: the submit and reset buttons.  These are pre-defined for you.

<dl>

<a name=var/submit></a>
<dt>submit</dt>

<dd>The submit interface variable is used to place the submit button on the
form.  You can assign a different value to this variable to change the text
displayed on the button face.  The default is "Submit".  The special control
variable <code>form_url</code> may be set to the URL that you want to
receive the submitted form.  This defaults to the form object used to
display the form.</dd>

<a name=var/reset></a>
<dt>reset</dt>

<dd>The reset interface variable is used to place a reset button on the
form.  When the user pushes the reset button, the displayed form is restored
to its initial state so the user can start over.  You can assign a different
value to this variable to change the text displayed on the button face.  The
default is "Reset".  If you set it to null, the form will not contain a
reset button.</dd>

</dl>

<a name=var/other>
<h3>Non-Interface Variables</h3>

<p>In addition to interface variables and their associated control
variables, you may have reason to define other variables that are used for
your own purposes.  These should be marked as such by defining them to be
<code>global</code>, <code>const</code>, or <code>tmp</code>.  Such
variables will be ignored when constructing the form interface.

<a name=var/other/form_reusable>
<h4>Reusable Forms</h4>

<p>One such pre-defined variable is the <code>form_reusable</code>
variable.  It defaults to a false value, indicating that you only intend the
user to submit the form once after each call to <code>DisplayForm()</code>.

<p>If you want the user to be able to repeatedly submit the form, you should
set this parameter to a true value (like 1).

<a name=var/other/form_title>
<h4>Form Title</h4>

<p>Another form control variable is <code>form_title</code>.  It is empty by
default, but you can set it to whatever title you wish the form to have.

<a name=var/other/form_cgi_mode>
<h4>CGI Mode</h4>

<p>The <code>form_cgi_mode</code> control variable can be used to turn on
CGI mode.  This is done for you automatically if you include the <a
href=CGI.html>html/CGI.dm</a> library.

<p>The main difference between normal mode and CGI mode is that form objects
do not persist.  When you display a form to the user using a form object,
that same form object is normally the one which processes the response.
That allows the form to retain state information, such as the result of
button clicks (custom prompts) and so on.

<p>In CGI mode, the original form object is destroyed and a new one is
created later when the user responds.  While this elliminates the
possibility of storing state information directly in the form object, it has
the advantage of not leaving around a dangling form object in case the user
never does respond.  If you don't need to use buttons or store any other
persistent information in the form, this is an option for you.  If you want
your forms to be used on the web (as a CGI program), they will ultimately
have to work this way anyway.

<p>Note that if you do include the CGI library and you are merely using the
forms in BYOND (not on the web) then you can still have specific forms
operate in non-CGI mode by assigning their form_cgi_mode back to 0.

<a name=var/other/form_method>
<h4>Form Submission Method</h4>

<p>The <code>form_method</code> variable controls the method used by the web
browser to submit the form results.  In BYOND mode (ie in Dream Seeker),
this must be "get".  When operating as a <a href=CGI.html>CGI</a> program
through a web server, it can also be "post".

<p>In a CGI program, the "get" method is usually preferred for cases in
which the result of the query is a cacheable response.  In other words, the
web browser can save the result and display it again from memory when the
user submits the same form data.  The "post" method is for situations in
which processing the form has a side-effect other than simply returning
results to the user.  In that case, the web browser cannot simply short-cut
the submission and display previous results.

<a name=var/other/form_default_maxlen>
<h4>Default Input Field Maximum Length</h4>

<p>The <code>form_default_maxlen</code> variable sets the default maximum
length for input fields when none is supplied.  If you do not specify a
maximum input length, no limit will be placed on the length of data the user
may submit.  The numerical value is the number of characters that will be
allowed.

<a name=var/other/form_default_size>
<h4>Default Input Field Size</h4>

<p>The <code>form_default_size</code> variable sets the default input field
display size.  If you do not specify a field size, the browser will choose
one for you.  The numerical value is the number of characters that will be
displayed.

<a name=var/other/form_sub_path>
<h4>Sub Path</h4>

<p>The <code>form_sub_path</code> variable contains extra path information
in the form's URL, which is tagged on after the <code>.dmb</code> name.  Be
careful if you use this, because the extra path information is included in
the default base href when you output an html page in CGI mode.

<a name=var/other/form_window>
<h4>Form Window</h4>

<p>The <code>form_window</code> variable contains <a href =
http://www.byond.com/docs/ref/info.html#/proc/browse>browse() </a> window
parameters.  This can be used to make the form popup in a new window, rather
than the default behavior, which is to appear in the browser panel on the main
Dream Seeker window.  This variable has no effect in CGI mode.

<a name=var/other/form_extra>
<h4>Extra Form Parameters</h4>

<p>The contents of the <code>form_extra</code> variable are inserted into the
form tag in the html output.  You could use this to insert extra code, such as
Java Script that is not supported directly by the other form variables.

<h5>Example:</h5>
<xmp>
Form/MyForm
	form_extra = {"OnSubmit='return confirm("Are you sure?");'"}
</xmp>

<p>See also, <a href=var/udef_extra>_extra</a> control variable.

<a name=proc/DisplayForm>
<h3>DisplayForm(mob/U = usr)</h3>

<p>The form's <code>DisplayForm()</code> procedure is used to send the form
to a player.  By default, it is sent to <code>usr</code>, but you can pass
in any mob reference you like.

<p>You should create a new instance of the form for each call to
<code>DisplayForm()</code>, unless you always wait until the form has been
completely processed before displaying it again.

<a name=proc/Initialize>
<h3>Initialize()</h3>

<p>The form's <code>Initialize()</code> procedure is called by
<code>DisplayForm()</code> before generating the HTML.  This is to allow you
to initialize form variables.  You do not have to do initialization of form
variables here; it is simply defined for your convenience.

<a name=proc/HtmlLayout>
<h3>HtmlLayout()</h3>

<p>You define the <code>HtmlLayout()</code> procedure to return the HTML text
describing the form.  The default procedure simply displays the name
of each interface variable followed by the interface element.  (You can also
use the <a href=#var/udef_label>_label</a> control variable to specify an
alternate prompt to display.)

<p>Perhaps the slickest part of the Form programming interface is how you
embed each interface element in your form layout text.  Before
<code>HtmlLayout()</code> is called, each interface variable is automatically
assigned to the corresponding HTML element.  All you have to do is insert
the variable into the layout text.  That elliminates most of the noisy HTML
so you can see what you are doing.

<p>If you are familiar with HTML, you may have noticed that the form layout
does not include the actual <code>&ls;FORM&gt;</code> element.  That is
automatically generated for you before the form is submitted to the user.

<a name=proc/ProcessForm>
<h3>ProcessForm()</h3>

<p>This procedure is called when the user submits the form.  Basic checks
are performed first to make sure the form was indeed displayed to the user
who is submitting it and that the input conforms to the specified limits.
After that, <code>ProcessForm()</code> is called and you can act upon the
user's input.

<p>If the form is reusable, there may be multiple calls to
<code>ProcessForm()</code> for each call to <code>DisplayForm()</code>.
Otherwise, there will only be one.

<a name=proc/GetSelfUrl>
<h3>GetSelfUrl(mob/U = usr)</h3>

<p>This procedure returns a URL text string containing all of the form
variables.  It may be used, for example, to generate a hyperlink that causes
the form to be processed.  Currently, prompt variables are not included in
the URL.

<h2>CGI Forms</h2>

<p>This form library has been designed to work transparently in BYOND or CGI
mode, as much as that is possible.  By including the CGI.dm library, you can
turn your <code>.dmb</code> into a CGI program to be executed by a web
server.  The purpose of doing so is to generate dynamic web pages and to
process user input via forms.

<p>More information about using forms in CGI mode will be provided here soon.
A key ellement will be having a web server that is configured to run
<code>.dmb</code> files as CGI programs.  The new hosting machine called
'Polaris' will be available soon for that purpose.

<p>Here is a sneak preview.  The following example produces a CGI program
that asks the user for a name and then issues a greeting using that name.
It only has one line specific to CGI mode so that the server knows which
form to display by default.

<xmp>
#include "html/CGI.dm"
#include "html/form.dm"

CGI/default_form = /Form/Hello

Form/Hello
   var
      name
   Initialize()
      name = usr.name
   ProcessForm()
      usr << "Hello, [name]!"
</xmp>

<p>As you can see, the calling of <code>DisplayForm()</code> and
<code>ProcessForm()</code> is all handled for you by the CGI object.  Not
only that but generation of the HTTP header and error logging are handled
behind the scenes with convenient defaults.  That leaves you with a tight
little piece of code!
