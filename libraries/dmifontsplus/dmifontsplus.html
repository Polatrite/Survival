<h1>DmiFontsPlus</h1>
<p>A utility/library combo for BYOND by Lummox JR</p>
<i>Version 1.0</i>
</div>

<p>DmiFontsPlus is a revamp of DmiFonts that uses functionality new to BYOND
4.0. Because the icon format and procs have changed, this is packaged as a new
library. Most of the procs are similar to before, but the main differences are
that the <tt>/iconset</tt> datum no longer exists, and procs that used to use
it now work with <tt>/icon</tt> directly. As with all big icons, state
<tt>"0,0"</tt> is the lower left corner.</p>

<p>The new icon format used by DmiFontsPlus has white text on a transparent
background, and uses alpha transparency. It is important when switching to
this library to re-make your font.dm and font.dmi files with the DmiFontsPlus
utility.</p>


<h2>The DmiFontsPlus Utility</h2>

<p>This library comes with a Windows utility, written in Visual C++. The
purpose of the program is to create a <tt>font.dm</tt> code file and a
<tt>font.dmi</tt> icon file to go with it, which can be compiled into your
programs and used easily. You will need a pair of files for every font and
style you want to use. Pick a font face, point size, bold or italic, and
decide what level of <a href="#aa">anti-aliasing</a> you want to use.</p>

<center><table class=fig width=519 cellspacing=3 cellpadding=0>
  <tr><td><img src="dmifontsplus1.png" width=519 height=294 /></td></tr>
  <tr><td><b>Figure 1:</b> The DmiFontsPlus program. Creating a font for use
    in DM is as easy as selecting a font and size and clicking Save.</td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>Press the <b>Font</b> button to select a font, which will then be displayed
in the window below. You can choose what to display as sample text, to decide
better which font you'd prefer to use before creating any files. After
choosing an anti-alasing level, press <b>Save</b> to create the files for
your font. Then move the files to your project, and you can start using
them.</p>

<p>The program is capable of saving different font scripts, so a font that
supports Greek characters can be saved in a Greek version. (DM doesn't
support Unicode, and generic Win32 doesn't support it <i>well</i>.)</p>

<p>You're likely to find for italic fonts that the <tt>overhang</tt> var has
not been set; it should be, for italics. When Windows italicizes many fonts the
overhang isn't set correctly. If there is no overhang, the utility will make
a guess at a good value but will not fill it in for you.</p>


<a name="aa"><h3>Anti-Aliasing</h3></a>

<p>Anti-aliasing determines how "smooth" your font appears. There can be
advantages as well as drawbacks to using this technique. To anti-alias a
font, the utility blows it up a certain number of times, then scales it
down using shades of gray. A non-antialiased font will just be
black-and-white, and is good for places where you want just text with a
transparent background. The more anti-aliasing you use, the more shades of
gray you get. A heavily anti-aliased font will try to show more detail, but
at the same time it might make your text too fuzzy to read if you use a small
point size.</p>

<p>The number in the box you select determines how many times to scale up the
font for anti-aliasing. If you select 4, then the font is blown up to 4&times;
its width and height, then scaled back down into 17 shades of gray (including
black and white). The number of gray shades you get is <i>n</i><sup>2</sup>+1,
where <i>n</i> is the scaling factor. You can only go as high as 256 shades
at most, if you pick <i>n</i>=16.</p>


<h2>The DmiFontsPlus Library</h2>

<p>The library consists of a datum which is used to keep info about the font,
and new procs available to the <tt>/icon</tt> datum. The <tt>/dmifont</tt>
datum defines the font's properties, including the size of the characters and
their widths. It can be used both for drawing text and measuring.</p>


<h3>Drawing Text</h3>

<p>It's important to understand the coordinate system used by this library.
If you want to draw text at the very upper left, for example, you'd draw it
at position (0,0). If you want to draw text exactly centered, you have to use
(16-<tt>width</tt>/2,16-<tt>height</tt>/2). You can find the width of your
text using the <tt>dmifont.GetWidth(text)</tt> proc, and the height from
<tt>dmifont.CountLines(text) * dmifont.height</tt>. There's a little more to
it than that, but that will be covered later.</p>

<center><table class=fig width=320 cellspacing=3 cellpadding=0>
  <tr><td><img src="dmifontsplus2.png" width=320 height=120 /></td></tr>
  <tr><td><b>Figure 2:</b> The layout of a 96&times;64-pixel icon. On the
    left are the coordinates used by DmiFontsPlus for drawing. On the
    right are the icon states you would use when assigning this icon to
    six atoms.</td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>Once text has been drawn, the icon states can be assigned to atoms. You
can tell how many icons are in the set by checking the <tt>setwidth</tt> and
<tt>setheight</tt> vars that have been added to the <tt>/icon</tt> datum.
These are not the actual full width and height, but the number of tiles wide
and tall. E.g., a 96&times;32-pixel icon has a <tt>setwidth</tt> of 3 and a
<tt>setheight</tt> of 1. Its icon states are <tt>"0,0"</tt>, <tt>"1,0"</tt>,
and <tt>"2,0"</tt>. Here's a quick example that uses an icon only one tile
high, but arbitrarily wide.</p>

<pre>obj/killcounter
  screen_loc = "SOUTHEAST"

  New(client/C)
    C.screen += src
    Update(C.mob.kills)

  proc/Update(kills)
    var/icon/I = font.DrawText(...)   // we'll get back to this
    overlays = list()
    var/obj/O = new/obj
    O.layer = 10
    O.icon = I
    for(var/i = 0, i &lt; I.setwidth, ++i)
      O.pixel_x = (i - I.setwidth + 1) * 32
      O.icon_state = "[i],0"
      overlays += O</pre>

<p>The call to <tt>DrawText()</tt> will be explained in the next section. For
now, what you need to know is this: When the <tt>/icon</tt> is created, by
default it uses blank transparent icons. The text drawn by <tt>DrawText()</tt>
is white on a transparent background.</p>

<p>Because BYOND's icon_state coordinates put 0,0 at the lower left, here's
how that loop would look if the <tt>/iconset</tt> could be more than one tile
high:</p>

<pre>    for(var/j = 0, j &lt; I.setheight, ++j)
      O.pixel_y = j * 32
      for(var/i = 0, i &lt; I.setwidth, ++i)
        var/icon/ic = s.GetIcon(i, 0)
        if(ic)
          O.pixel_x = (i - I.setwidth + 1) * 32
          O.icon_state = "[i],[j]"
          overlays += O</pre>


<h4>Colored Text And Outlines</h4>

<p>Since text created by DmiFontsPlus defaults to white on a black background,
you'll often want to change it. To change the foreground color, you can simply
add or multiply the color you want via <tt>Blend()</tt>. To change the
background, you can use <tt>Blend()</tt> with a solid color and
<tt>ICON_UNDERLAY</tt>.</p>

<pre>// make text red-on-black
icon.Blend(rgb(255, 0, 0), ICON_MULTIPLY)
icon.Blend(rgb(0, 0, 0), ICON_UNDERLAY)</pre>

<p>More often, you'll want to add an outline to your text. Using the
<tt>icon.DFP_Outline()</tt> proc, you can change the foreground color and
add an outline at the same time. There are two arguments: The foreground
color, and the outline color:</p>

<pre>// red text with a white outline
icon.DFP_Outline(rgb(255, 0, 0), rgb(255, 255, 255))</pre>

<p>You can also expand the text outward using <tt>icon.DFP_Dilate()</tt>,
which takes no arguments.</p>


<h3>Using font files</h3>

<p>Once you've run the program and created the <tt>.dm</tt> and <tt>.dmi</tt>
files for a font, and copied those fonts over to your project directory, you
can use them. First, click the checkbox on <tt><i>yourfont</i>.dm</tt> to
make sure it compiles with your project. Now open it up. You'll see something
a lot like this.</p>

<pre>dmifont/ArialBold7pt_AA16
    name = "Arial Bold 7pt (AA 16)"
    height = 11
    ascent = 9
    descent = 2
    avgwidth = 5
    maxwidth = 24
    overhang = 0
    inleading = 2
    exleading = 0
    defchar = 31
    start = 31
    end = 255

    antialias = 16

    metrics = list(\
        1, 4, 1,	/* char 31 */ \
        0, 0, 2,	/* char 32 */ \
        ...
        0, 5, 0,	/* char 255 */ \
        225)

    defined = list(\
        null, null, ... null,\
        ...
        ".", "/", "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", ":", ";", "&lt;",\
        ... )

    icon = 'ArialBold7pt_AA16.dmi'</pre>

<p>The program has gone ahead and filled in all the values needed to use this
font. So the first step to use the font in your own game is to initialize it.</p>

<pre>var/dmifont/ArialBold7pt_AA16/tinyfont = new</pre>

<p>Besides all the vars you can use like <tt>height</tt>, there are several
important procs. <tt>GetWidth()</tt> will give you the width of a line of
text, or the longest width of more than one line. <tt>CountLines()</tt> will
tell you how many lines you have, where each line is separated by a
<tt>\n</tt> newline character.</p>

<p>That's almost enough for very crude text output, so let's go back to that
kill counter example. I'd like to make the text right-aligned to the screen,
and drawn at the very bottom.</p>

<pre>obj/killcounter
  proc/Update(kills)
    var/txt = "[kills] kill\s"
    var/size = font.RoundUp32(font.GetWidth(txt))
    var/icon/I = font.DrawText(txt, size, 32 - font.height,\
                               flags = DF_JUSTIFY_RIGHT, icons_y = 1)</pre>

<p>First, it's important to know just how big an <tt>/icon</tt> will be
needed to draw this text, so <tt>RoundUp32()</tt> will take the value of
<tt>font.GetWidth(txt)</tt> and round it up to a multiple of 32 pixels: the
size of an icon. So if the text is, say, 81 pixels wide, the next highest
multiple of 32 is 96, which is 96&divide;32 = 3 icons wide.</p>

<p>Now in <tt>DrawText()</tt>, the <tt>size, 32 - font.height</tt> portion
looks simple enough: Those are the coordinates where the text should be drawn.
Since it's right-aligned, text will be drawn out to the left of those
coordinates. But it's still drawn downward. 32 is the <tt>y</tt> coordinate
just past the bottom edge of the icon, so going up by <tt>font.height</tt>,
subtracting it from 32, will draw text as low down as it can go. (Actually
you can draw even lower. If you don't use any descending characters like a
lowercase y, just subtract <tt>font.ascent</tt> instead.)</p>

<p>The two arguments that may not look as clear are <tt>flags</tt> and
<tt>icons_y</tt>. In <tt>flags</tt> you can specify options for word wrapping
and justification; this text is right-justified, so it uses the flag
<tt>DF_JUSTIFY_RIGHT</tt>. The <tt>icons_y</tt> var is a limit for how many
tiles to use when creating the icon; if you don't give it a limit it will
expand as far as the text. Since the example only calls for one tile's worth
of height, <tt>icons_y</tt> is set to 1. There's also an <tt>icons_x</tt> if
you want to limit the width, too--but text will try to draw itself right on
past that.</p>


<h3>Limiting Text</h3>

<p>You can constrain text even further using the <tt>width</tt> argument, and
<tt>maxlines</tt>. Text will then wrap words to try to fit within the limits
you demand. Depending on the flags you use, it may just cut off when it runs
out of room, or it may trail off in an ellipsis (...) instead.</p>

<pre>var/icon/I = font.DrawText(mylifestory, 0, 0, width = 160, maxlines = 10,\
                           flags = DF_WRAP_ELLIPSIS)</pre>

<p>Some life stories are shorter than others, but you'd probably see your text
cut off on the 10th line with an ellipsis after it. If you wanted to show the
rest of it later, and need to know where you left off, send a list (it must
already be initialized) to the proc as <tt>leftover</tt>.</p>

<pre>var/list/nexttext = new
var/icon/I = font.DrawText(mylifestory, 0, 0, width = 160, maxlines = 10,\
                           flags = DF_WRAP_ELLIPSIS, leftover = nexttext)</pre>

<p>The list will come back either empty, or with a string starting on the 11th
line of <tt>mylifestory</tt>.</p>

<p>You can also indent your text using <tt>firstline</tt>. If you set that to
10, <tt>DrawText()</tt> will indent the first line by 10 pixels. Or you can
use it for hanging indents, by making it a negative value. (Note: If you use
a negative <tt>firstline</tt>, the first line is allowed to be even wider
than <tt>width</tt> by that amount. If <tt>firstline=-20</tt>, the first line
may be 20 pixels wider than the others.)</p>

<h4>Preformatting with <tt>GetLines()</tt></h4>

<p>Often it's helpful to preformat text before sending it to
<tt>DrawText()</tt>. That way you can know just how wide it will be when
formatted, or how many lines it will have. To do that, use the
<tt>GetLines()</tt> proc. It's practically the same as <tt>DrawText()</tt>, but
it leaves out anything related to the drawing itself like the x,y coordinates,
<tt>icons_x</tt> and <tt>icons_y</tt>, etc. It returns a string, broken up into
lines with <tt>\n</tt> where <tt>DrawText()</tt> would have broken it up. Using
<tt>GetWidth()</tt> and <tt>CountLines()</tt> on the result can help you
fine-tune where you want to put everything before you draw it. If you use
<tt>GetLines()</tt> to preformat your text, you can also use the
<tt>DF_NO_FORMAT</tt> flag in <tt>DrawText()</tt> to speed up drawing.</p>

<h4>Word breaks</h4>

<p>Word wrapping is done at the best possible places: at a space if one is
handy, or at a forced line break (<tt>\n</tt>). If no break is available,
a word will be split up just before reaching the maximum width and continued
on the next line. However you may want to provide break points of your own,
such as after a hyphen. Any character with an ASCII value under 10 is
considered a "soft break". The character won't display normally, but will
allow text to be broken up at that point.</p>

<p>The tab character <tt>\t</tt> is a soft break character; in ASCII it's 9. A
good place to use it would be at the end of punctuation, if for some reason
no space was put there, or after a hyphen. Another soft break is ASCII 8, the
"hyphen break". (In the C language, ASCII 8 is <tt>\b</tt> for backspace, but
in DM it has no equivalent and there's no easy way to add it to a string
except by using <tt>ascii2text(8)</tt>. Sorry.) The hyphen break will insert
a hyphen if it's used as a soft break (and will only allow the word to be
broken there if a hyphen fits).</p>

<p>Spacers are also available for text justification. ASCII characters 1
through 7 are justification characters, representing 1 through 7 pixels of
extra padding. Do not rely on these remaining constant, however, as new soft
breaks may be added in the future if necessary.</p>


<h3>More Examples</h3>

<p>The uses of this library are limitless. By exploring your options you'll
probably discover some unique ideas that no one has even imagined yet. You
can make an interface really sparkle, or personalize a game, or make it
easier to tell players apart when custom colors or icons just aren't
enough.</p>

<h4>Name Labels</h4>

<p>One idea that appears in the demo is to draw a name beneath each player when
the log in. This can make it a lot easier to tell who's who in the thick of a
game.</p>

<pre>var/dmifont/Arial7pt/namefont = new

mob
  Login()
    // find the most lines we can fit in 1 icon's height
    var/lines = round(32 / namefont.height)
    var/txt = namefont.GetLines(key, width = 96, maxlines = lines,\
                                flags = DF_WRAP_ELLIPSIS)
    // find out just how big this has to be
    var/size = namefont.RoundUp32(namefont.GetWidth(txt))
    var/icon/I = namefont.DrawText(txt, size / 2, 0,\
                     width = size, maxlines = lines,\
                     flags = DF_JUSTIFY_CENTER,\
                     icons_x = size / 32, icons_y = 1)
    var/obj/O = new
    O.pixel_y = -32
    O.icon = I
    overlays = list()   // reset overlays
    for(var/xx = 0, xx &lt; I.setwidth, ++xx)
      O.icon_state = "[xx],0"
      O.pixel_x = (xx + (1 - I.setwidth) / 2) * 32
      overlays += O
    del(O)

    Logout()
        overlays = list()</pre>

<p>Most names should fit nicely within the limits. Arial at 7 points is 11
pixels high, which is just a fraction too tall to fit 3 lines--so it will fit
2 lines, which is a good amount. There's not much point letting the name get
huge, anyway.</p>

<p>You may find that white isn't the ideal color for the label. You can use the
techniques discussed earlier to color it in. One quick change is to use
<tt>DFP_Outline()</tt> to outline the name.</p>

<pre>I.DFP_Outline(rgb(255, 255, 255), rgb(0, 0, 0))</pre>

<p>You can also use <tt>QuickName()</tt> easily create the same overlays.
This works the same way in DmiFontsPlus as in the original DmiFonts
library.</p>

  <dt>proc/GetLines(text, width=-1, flags=0, firstline=0, maxlines=-1, list/leftover)</dt>
    <dd>Get a modified version of <tt>text</tt> broken into lines as they
      would be shown in <tt>DrawText()</tt> with the same parameters.</dd>

  <dt>proc/GetCutoffIndex(text, width=-1, flags=0, firstline=0, maxlines=-1)</dt>
    <dd>Returns the index in <tt>text</tt> where the next line would start
      off, after the text that would be displayed in <tt>DrawText()</tt>.
      Where <tt>GetLines()</tt> would give you some text to work with,
      <tt>copytext(text, GetCutoffIndex(...))</tt> could pick up where
      <tt>GetLines()</tt> left off.</dd>

  <dt>proc/GetLine(text, index=1)</dt>
    <dd>Get a complete line of text starting at <tt>index</tt> and ending at
      either the end of the string or the first <tt>\n</tt> found.</dd>

  <dt>proc/GetLastLineIndex(text, index=1)</dt>
    <dd>Find the index of the beginning of the last line in a block of text,
      just after a <tt>\n</tt> character.</dd>

  <dt>proc/GetNextIndex(text, index)</dt>
    <dd>Following a break point (found by <tt>GetLineUpTo()</tt> or by
      searching for <tt>\n</tt>), find a suitable index to begin the next
      line.</dd>

  <dt>proc/RoundUp32(n)</dt>
    <dd>Round <tt>n</tt> up to the next highest multiple of 32. This is a
      good way to tell how many icons will be needed to fit a piece of
      text.</dd>

  <dt>proc/SyncWidth(firstchar, lastchar)</dt>
    <dd>Create a modified copy of this font to make a range of characters
      monospaced. Supply <tt>firstchar</tt> and <tt>lastchar</tt> as
      character codes (such as 48 and 57 for all digits), and the proc will
      return the new font. This is a good way to display scores, clocks, etc.
      Use the <tt>DF_INCLUDE_AC</tt> flag when rendering text in this format,
      unless the first character of your text (or the last, if
      right-justified, or both if center- or full-justified) was not
      modified. See <tt>DrawText()</tt> below for an explanation of the
      flag.</dd>

  <dt>proc/DrawText(text, x, y, width=-1, flags=0, firstline=0, maxlines=-1, icons_x=0, icons_y=0, icon/drawover, list/leftover)</dt>
    <dd><p>Draw <tt>text</tt> at position <tt>x</tt>,<tt>y</tt> in an
      <tt>/icon</tt>. <tt>x</tt> is the distance from the left edge, and
      <tt>y</tt> is <b>from the top</b>. The coordinates are for the upper
      left edge of the text. (If you want to draw from the baseline, subtract
      <tt>ascent</tt> from <tt>y</tt>.) The drawing area is an
      <tt>/icon</tt> datum returned by this proc. Text is white on a
      transparent background, but you can change it using the procs in
      <tt>/icon</tt>.</p>

      <p>If you specify <tt>icons_x</tt> or <tt>icons_y</tt> you can
      restrict the <tt>/icon</tt> to a particular size (in tiles, not
      pixels), or it will expand to fit the text.</p>

      <p>The <tt>width</tt> argument is the maximum width you will allow for
      your text, or -1 (the default) for as much width as possible. You can
      also use <tt>firstline</tt> to specify an indentation for the first
      line.</p>

      <p>You can limit text to a number of lines with <tt>maxlines</tt>, or
      leave <tt>maxlines</tt> set to -1 for unlimited lines.</p>

      <p>The <tt>flags</tt> argument allows you to decide how you want your text
      wrapped or justified. Possible flag values are:</p><ul>
        <li><b>DF_WRAP</b>: Word-wrap text to fit. (default)</li>
        <li><b>DF_WRAP_NONE</b>: Do not wrap text.</li>
        <li><b>DF_WRAP_ELLIPSIS</b>: Wrap text. If there is more text than
          can be printed within <tt>maxlines</tt>, put an ellipsis (...) at
          the end of the last line to show there is more.</li>
        <li><b>DF_WRAP_ONELINE</b>: Do not wrap each line, but constrain it
          to <tt>width</tt> and use ... at the end to show there is more.</li>
        <li><b>DF_JUSTIFY_LEFT</b>: Left-justify text. (default)</li>
        <li><b>DF_JUSTIFY_RIGHT</b>: Right-justify text.</li>
        <li><b>DF_JUSTIFY_CENTER</b>: Center text.</li>
        <li><b>DF_JUSTIFY</b>: Justify text to both margins.</li>
        <li><b>DF_INCLUDE_AC</b>: Include the "before" (A) and "after" (C)
          widths of the beginning and end characters on each line,
          respectively.</li>
        <li><b>DF_SET_WIDTH</b>: Round <tt>width</tt> up to the nearest
          multiple of 32, or if not constrained find width first and then
          round up. Also adjust <tt>x</tt> if right- or center-justified so
          position 0 is at the center or right edge. This flag is meaningless
          to <tt>GetLines()</tt>.</li>
        <li><b>DF_NO_FORMAT</b>: Do not format this text by calling
          <tt>GetLines()</tt>; assume <tt>GetLines()</tt> was already called
          in advance.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>By adding <tt>flag</tt> values together or using the <tt>|</tt>
      operator on them, you can use different combinations of word wrapping
      and justification.</p>

      <p>The <tt>drawover</tt> var is an <tt>/icon</tt> to draw on top of.
      This may be preferable to creating a new <tt>/icon</tt> and adding
      it to another one.</p>

      <p>If you supply a list for <tt>leftover</tt>, it will be cleared out and
      filled with the rest of the text (if any) that didn't get drawn. If its
      length is 0 afterward, all of the text could be drawn to the
      constraints specified.</p></dd>

  <dt>proc/DrawChar(charcode, x, y, icon/ic, charwidth=maxwidth)</dt>
    <dd>Draw a character at position <tt>x</tt>,<tt>y</tt> in the icon.<br>
      <tt>charwidth</tt> is equivalent to <tt>GetCharBWidth(charcode)</tt>,
      but is passed by <tt>DrawText()</tt> for the sake of speed.</dd>

  <dt>proc/GetLinesMultiFont(list/items, width=-1, flags=0, firstline=0, maxheight=-1, list/leftover)</dt>
    <dd>Used internally by <tt>DrawTextMultiFont()</tt>. Returns a
      <tt>/dmifonttextline</tt> datum, which is the first in a double-linked
      list. If a list is supplied for <tt>leftover</tt>, it will be cleared
      out and filled with any lines and font instructions that didn't get
      converted to datums because of height restrictions.</dd>

  <dt>proc/WillFitMultiFont(list/items, width=-1, flags=0, firstline=0, maxheight=-1)</dt>
    <dd>Returns 1 if drawing text via <tt>DrawTextMultiFont()</tt> with the
      same parameters would fit well, without any bad break points and
      without running out of room.</dd>

  <dt>proc/DrawTextMultiFont(list/items, x, y, width=-1, flags=0, firstline=0, maxheight=-1, icons_x, icons_y, icon/drawover, list/leftover)</dt>
    <dd><p>Draws a block of text in changing fonts. Most of the arguments are
      the same as in <tt>DrawText()</tt>, except for a few:</p>

      <p><tt>items</tt> is a list of text and fonts to draw, starting in this
      font (<tt>src</tt>). The proc will run down through the list and draw
      text or change fonts as requested. If a font is found, that font is
      used for subsequent text. If null is found, <tt>src</tt> becomes the
      default font again. An items list might look like this:</p>

      <pre>list("This is ", boldfont, "bold", null, " text!")</pre>

      <p>The <tt>items</tt> var can also be given a <tt>/dmifonttextline</tt>
      datum, for those crazy enough to work with it manually.</p>

      <p><tt>maxheight</tt> is the maximum height of all lines. Since the fonts
      may vary in size, <tt>maxlines</tt> wouldn't be appropriate.</p>

      <p>If you supply a list for <tt>leftover</tt>, it will be cleared out and
      filled with items from the <tt>items</tt> list that didn't get drawn.
      The list can be used for a future call to this proc to display the
      rest.</p></dd>

  <dt>proc/KeyToBreakable(text)</dt>
    <dd>Breaks up a string of text with soft-break characters at appropriate
      points. This is designed for player keys but can be used with any
      text. The rules for inserting soft-breaks are:<ol>
      <li>Do not add breaks around any spaces or other break chars.</li>
      <li>Add a hyphen break between a digit (0-9) and a non-digit.</li>
      <li>Add a hyphen break between a lowercase letter and an uppercase
        letter that immediately follows it.</li>
      <li>Add a soft break between a punctuation character and a
        non-punctuation character that immediately follows it.</li>
      </ol></dd>

  <dt>proc/QuickName(atom/A, txt, color="#fff", outline, top, size=3, layer=FLY_LAYER)</dt>
    <dd>Creates a set of overlays for an atom (usually a mob) to represent a
      name. By default this will appear below the atom unless you use a nonzero
      value for <tt>top</tt>. <tt>outline</tt> is the color of an optional
      outline, or use any nonzero, nontext value for a black outline.
      <tt>size</tt> is the number of icons in width the name may be; at most it
      can be 8. You may also specify the layer.</dd>

  <dt>proc/QuickText(atom/A, txt, color="#fff", outline, x=0, y=0, bottom, justify=DF_JUSTIFY_LEFT, layer=FLY_LAYER)</dt>
    <dd>Creates a set of overlays for an atom, usually an obj such as in a HUD.
      At most your text should only be 128 pixels long. <tt>x</tt> counts the
      number of pixels from the left, or right if right-justified; centered
      text ignores <tt>x</tt>. By default <tt>y</tt> counts the number of
      pixels from the top, unless you use a nonzero value for <tt>bottom</tt>.
      <tt>outline</tt> is the color of an optional outline (or any nonzero,
      nontext value for black), which will offset the text to fit. Text may be
      left-justified, centered, or right-justified by using the appropriate
      <tt>justify</tt> flags; the overlays will start on the target atom
      <tt>A</tt> and move off to the right and/or left as needed. You may also
      specify the layer.</dd>

  <dt>proc/BlendIcon(icon/c, x, y, operation=ICON_OR, icon_width=32, icon_height=32)</dt>
    <dd>Blends a single-tiled icon at offset position (<tt>x</tt>,<tt>y</tt>)
      onto this big icon.<br>
      <tt>icon_width</tt> and <tt>icon_height</tt> specify
      the maximum width of the icon from its upper left corner. They are not
      not used as hard limits, but rather to keep from doing unnecessary work
      on other icons in the set.</dd>

  <dt>proc/DFP_Dilate()</dt>
    <dd>"Dilates" the total image by adding copies shifted north, south, east
      and west by one pixel. Very useful for creating outlines of text.</dd>

  <dt>proc/DFP_Outline(in_color, out_color)</dt>
    <dd>Converts the icon from white-on-transparent to outlined text with the
      colors you supply.</dd>
